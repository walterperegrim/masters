# UMD Masters in Machine Learning
- A detailed discussion of my academic performance in the nine curriculum-based courses I took is unnecessary as my grades should speak for themselves. Instead I’d like to take this opportunity to highlight the curricular efforts that aren’t found on my transcripts, specifically class projects. Only three of the nine courses required a final project, and for each one I forwent the option to collaborate with fellow students so that I could choose a unique research topic and move in my own direction at my own pace. The unifying aim of the efforts was to nourish my interest in and comprehension of neuromorphic computing by cultivating a spike-based intuition of the curriculum’s more conventional machine learning paradigms.
